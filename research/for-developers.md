# For developers

## FL26 Mod Studio and the world file

The modules read which leagues a world has from `SiderAddons\modules\fl26world.txt`, written
by the League Builder (FL26 Mod Studio, `tools/leaguebuilder.py`). A module that finds no file
keeps its built-in list. The format, what the program touches in the game folder, and the
league package format (`.fl26pack`) are in [mod-studio.md](mod-studio.md).

## Regenerating the patch set

You need to regenerate `fl26caps.lua` when your world's rulebook ids are not all in the
shipped date table (more than 39 leagues, a non-default `--reg-from`, a data pack that
already uses some of those ids), or when you change a cap.

Requirements: Python 3.10+, `pip install capstone`, the game exe reachable through
`FL26_DIR` (or `FL26_EXE`), and this repository's `patches/` and `sider/fl26caps.template.lua`.

The shipped set was generated with:

```
python tools\patchset.py teams-coaches-regs-players-dates-matches-upper-mlcopy-fixtures ^
    --player-cap 51729 ^
    --date-keys 11,49,60,61,62,74,76,93,94,96,98,100,109,110,111,112,113,114,121,138,139,140,143,144,145,146,170,171,173,174,176,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,190 ^
    --date-offsets 11:1,49:2,60:1,61:2,62:5,74:5,76:2,93:6,94:2,96:2,98:4,100:1,109:1,110:1,111:1,112:4,113:5,114:2,121:2,138:2,139:2,140:2,143:5,144:2,145:2,146:6,170:4,171:6,173:1,174:0,176:1,178:6,179:4,180:0,181:1,182:5,183:1,184:6,185:1,190:2 ^
    --cup-keys 186
```

- `--date-keys` are the rulebook ids of your new leagues (the `regulation ids` line of
  `mkworld.py`). They must be within 1–255. **Passing them is not optional in practice.**
  Leave the flag off and the generator falls back to a single test league: every other
  league's matches are then allocated with no date, nothing ever puts them on a calendar
  day, and those leagues quietly play nothing from the second season onward. That is
  exactly how the set published on 2026-09-16 shipped broken; see
  [known-issues.md](known-issues.md). The generator now says out loud when it falls back.
- `--date-offsets` assigns each key a weekday shift 0–6. A bare list (`--date-offsets 2,6,5,1`)
  deals shifts round-robin; the `key:shift` form above assigns them one by one. Spreading
  leagues over the emptier weekdays is what keeps the 280-ids-per-day calendar from
  overflowing; an even deal is not always the flattest.
- `--cup-keys` gives a regulation a cup's calendar instead of a league's (186 is the
  Conference League's regulation in a world built with `mkuecl.py`).
- `--player-cap` must satisfy `cap ≡ 17 (mod 32)` because of how the second copy is
  memcpy'd; the generator refuses anything else and tells you the nearest valid value.

The generator writes `patches/<set>.json` and `sider/fl26caps.lua`. It refuses to emit a set
while any table reference is unattributed, and it runs two checks that each exist because of
a real load-path bug:

- `check_biased()` — the pre-biased displacements inside the save/load copy code must agree
  with one another (the bug behind "the manager's name disappears after a load").
- `check_copy_fields()` — every occurrence, anywhere in the code section, of an offset the
  copy moves must be either patched or named in `copy.mlcopy.field_scan_allow` with a reason.
  This is what the accessor `0x140af3680` slipped through: its index bounds were raised while
  the base displacements beside them kept the shipped layout, and a loaded season then wrote
  regulation records over the team array.

## What the set name means

`teams-coaches-regs-players-dates-matches-upper-mlcopy`: each part is a family of patches
in `layout.json` — grow the team table and relocate it; grow coaches; grow regulations;
raise the player cap in place; install the date-spread stub; grow the match record table;
relocate the "upper belt" of small tables after it; grow the Master League save/load copy
(`mlcopy`). Smaller sets exist for bisection but are not shipped here.

## Reading a crash

A fault offset from Event Viewer plus `0x140000000` is the absolute address. Sections:
`.trace` (game code) is where every crash we could reason about lives; `0x1484ed4c0` is
outside it and is the shipped generation crash (it also happens with none of our modules and
no patch set; see known-issues.md). The five guards' headers describe the
disassembly around each guarded site, and the crash table in known-issues.md lists what is
open.

If you enabled minidumps, a stack of return addresses in `.trace` plus the register set is
usually enough to attribute a crash to a table walk; the record strides worth knowing are
players 0x17c, clubs 0x690, coaches 0x258, regulations 0x314, match records 0x254 (596).

Tools we use in development but did not include: the automation harness that plays seasons
unattended with a virtual pad and screen reading, and the disassembly indices. They are tied
to one machine and would mislead more than help. `livedump.py` is the one reader that is
here, because `dayplan.py` cannot work without it and the day-spread problem is one every
large world runs into. It reads the running game only; it writes nothing.

## Contributing

Issues with fault offsets, saves and `mkworld.py` output are the most valuable thing right
now. Pull requests are welcome for anything in `tools/`; for `sider/` and `patches/`,
please describe the disassembly evidence in the PR the way the module headers do.
