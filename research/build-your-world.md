# Build your world

This generates a Sider `livecpk` root holding new leagues, new placeholder clubs and
placeholder squads, built from **your own** game's tables. Three steps: extract, generate,
activate.

The clubs are deliberately placeholders — `FL League 03`, `FL 0042`, players `FL P17021` —
because the point of this beta is to find out where the game breaks with a lot of them.
Naming and dressing them is ordinary Team.bin and kit editing on top of the same files.

## 1. Extract the pesdb tables from your game

The tables live inside the game's CPK archives under `common/etc/pesdb/`. The tools read
them from a plain folder, so unpack once:

```
python tools\cpkx.py "C:\Football Life 2026\download\<data cpk>" C:\work\pesdb
```

Which CPK holds the current tables depends on your install; the newest data pack wins. Look
for one whose listing (`python tools\cpk.py <file>`) contains `common/etc/pesdb/Team.bin`.
After extraction, `C:\work\pesdb\common\etc\pesdb\` must contain at least:

```
Competition.bin  CompetitionRegulation.bin  CompetitionEntry.bin
Team.bin  Player.bin  PlayerAssignment.bin
```

Tell the tools where things are (a `.bat` or your shell profile is the convenient place):

```
set FL26_DIR=C:\Football Life 2026
set FL26_PESDB=C:\work\pesdb\common\etc\pesdb
```

## 2. Generate leagues, clubs and squads

Two commands. The first builds clubs and competitions, the second gives every new club a
squad. `--out` is the livecpk root; put it under `SiderAddons\livecpk\` with a name that
sorts to the top, for example `_FL26World`.

```
python tools\mkworld.py   --base %FL26_PESDB% --out "C:\Football Life 2026\SiderAddons\livecpk\_FL26World" --leagues 6 --clubs 20
python tools\mkplayers.py --base %FL26_PESDB% --out "C:\Football Life 2026\SiderAddons\livecpk\_FL26World" --per 30 --cap 51729
```

What the options mean:

| option | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--leagues N` | 6 | how many new leagues |
| `--clubs M` | 20 | clubs per league |
| `--sizes A,B,C` | | different sizes, cycled over the run, e.g. `--sizes 24,22,20,18` (10–30 all work; above 30 the round list runs out) |
| `--region N` | 16 | which existing menu region the leagues appear under (16 = England's slot) |
| `--cid-from N` | 130 | first competition id; leave it |
| `--reg-from N` | 1 | first rulebook id, handed out from the free list; **leave it** (see below) |
| `--cap` (mkplayers) | 30001 | must be **51729** with this patch set; it is the player table size |
| `--per` (mkplayers) | 23 | players per club; the budget is 51,729 − 27,927 shipped = 23,802 players ≈ 793 squads of 30, so `--per 30` fits a 39-league world |

`mkworld.py` prints what it did. **Keep that output** — it lists the competition ids and
rulebook ids it used, and you will need it for the check below and for any bug report:

```
competition ids 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135
regulation  ids 11, 12, 13, 49, 60, 61
  FL League 01     competition 130  regulation 11   20 clubs 1001-1020
  FL League 02     competition 131  regulation 12   20 clubs 1021-1040
  ...
  wrote Team.bin (863 records)
  wrote Coach.bin (1081 records, 120 new managers)

6 leagues, 120 clubs added; 863 clubs in all
```

(The summary lines show the first eight ids; the per-league lines below them always show
every league's ids.)

### The one check that matters: rulebook ids

A new league gets its fixture dates from a small table inside `fl26caps.lua`, keyed by the
league's **rulebook (regulation) id**. A league whose id is not in that table is never
scheduled: it appears in the menus, you can pick a club from it, and the season generator
simply gives it no matches. The shipped `fl26caps.lua` covers these 39 ids (and 145, see below):

```
11 49 60 61 62 74 76 93 94 96 98 100 109 110 111 112 113 114 121
138 139 140 143 144 190 146 170 171 173 174 176 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185
```

The 25th league is on **190**. Worlds built before 25 September 2026 have it on **145**
instead; 145 stays covered everywhere, so those worlds keep working. It was moved because
the game's own J1 League relegates into 145, which sent Japanese clubs into that league.

`mkworld.py` hands rulebook ids out from the bottom of the free list, so with an unmodified
FL26 install and the default `--reg-from`, the first 39 leagues you build get exactly these
ids. **Compare the `regulation` column of the per-league lines with the list above.** If every id is in
the list, you are fine. If not — more than 39 leagues, a different `--reg-from`, or a data
pack that already uses some of these ids — that league will not be scheduled, and you need a
regenerated patch set: see [for-developers.md](for-developers.md).

The same 39 ids are listed a second time, in `sider/fl26joindll.lua` (`local IDS = { ... }`
near the top). That list says which leagues the module presents to the season on the first
registration day; a league that is dated but not in it is entered only if the game lists it
by itself, which a league standing in a country of its own is not (see
[how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md)). If you changed the ids, edit that list too — it is a
plain text edit, no regeneration needed. Ids in the list that your world does not use are
harmless; the log notes them as `no-record` and moves on.

Why an id decides this at all is explained in [how-it-works.md](how-it-works.md): the dates
come from a switch compiled into the executable, keyed by the id, and most free ids land on
an entry that writes nothing.

### If you build many leagues: spread them over the week

A calendar day holds **280 matches** and the scheduler drops the rest without a word. No
error, no log line, nothing in the world files — a league just plays one round fewer than it
should. Each new league is given a shift of 0 to 6 days so that they do not all want the
same weekday, and the shipped set already carries a spread measured on a 39-league world.

Past about 39 leagues you need your own. `tools/dayplan.py` reads a running season out of
the game, separates the shipped competitions' load from each of your leagues', and prints
the `--date-offsets` argument for `patchset.py` that makes the busiest day as quiet as it
can be:

```
python tools/dayplan.py --set <your set name>
python tools/dayplan.py --set <your set name> --demand   # after the first rollover
```

Then regenerate the set with what it printed and create the season again. Use `--demand`
once a world has rolled over: walking the calendar only counts the matches that were
accepted, so a day that turned matches away still reads as a tidy 280, while the match
records show what was really wanted.

### Sizes worth knowing

Our largest built world: **39 leagues, 793 clubs**, built with `--leagues 39` and sizes
around 20; the world that has been played across four seasons is 39 leagues of exactly 20,
780 clubs. Bigger is possible on paper (1,600 club slots) but **1,536 clubs in total is a
hard wall** in the season generator, and a calendar day holds 280 match ids at most, so the
scheduler runs out of room somewhere past 39 leagues on the same weekdays. Start smaller.
A world of 6 leagues × 20 clubs is a fine first test; 12 leagues with `--sizes 24,22,20,18,16,14`
is a good second.

The world played most recently (2026-09-24) goes further: 39 leagues of 10 to 24 clubs
(some playing each other three or four times), 780 new clubs of which 602 are in a league,
30 players each, and the Champions League, Europa League and a Conference League in the 2024
format. That needs experimental modules and five more tools on top of this page; the route,
command by command, is in
[sider/experimental](../sider/experimental/README.md#the-european-format-and-league-sizes-fl26swiss).

## 3. Activate the root in sider.ini

Only one such world may be active at a time. Near the top of `sider.ini`, with the other
`cpk.root` lines, add yours **above** the others so it takes precedence:

```ini
cpk.root = ".\livecpk\_FL26World"
```

`tools\siderroot.py _FL26World` does this for you: it comments out every other `_FL26*`
root and enables the one you name, then prints what is active.

To try a different world, build it into a different folder and switch the root line. To go
back to the shipped game, comment the line out. **Delete or move your Master League save
between worlds**: a save carries the club table of the world it was made in.

## 4. Look at it

- Exhibition: both new clubs should be selectable under the region you chose (England by
  default), with placeholder names, and the match should kick off with 22 players (in the
  default kit until you run `mkkits.py`).
- Master League: pick a club from a new league, pick a manager; the season should generate
  (retry once or twice if it crashes during generation — see known-issues), and the hub
  should show the standings of your league on the right and four fixtures at the bottom.

### Divisions, and why they matter more than they look

Every league these tools build is a copy of a first-division prototype, which means that by
default **all of your leagues are first divisions**. Two consequences, both measured:

* a first division in a region is offered European places by the engine, so your new clubs
  can turn up in the Champions League;
* the promotion resolver only looks for the league above when the lower league is division 2
  or 3, so three leagues linked as a pyramid but all left as division 1 will never promote
  or relegate anybody.

```
python tools\mkworld.py --base %FL26_PESDB% --out <root> --leagues 9 --tiers 1,2,3 --group-regions 3
```

`--tiers` cycles over the run, `--group-regions` says how many consecutive leagues share a
region -- so the line above builds three three-division pyramids, each one inside its own
region, which is the shape the engine understands. The division *number* stops at three, but
a pyramid does not have to: see [limits.md](limits.md), and
`sider/experimental/fl26rank.lua` below, which raises the number itself to seven.

Regions are given with `--region N` (one for all) or `--regions A,B,C` (dealt out). The
shipped game reads a region number below 29 and ignores anything higher, so that is the
ceiling unless `sider/experimental/fl26reg64.lua` is installed, which raises it to 64. Above
the shipped 24 a region has no heading of its own and borrows the previous country's name in
the menus; it still groups the leagues correctly. Four ids -- 11, 13, 14 and 20 -- have no
heading row at all and are otherwise free.

`tools\deepen.py` does the other version of this: it takes one of your leagues and puts it
**underneath an existing pyramid**, one division lower -- France and Italy each ship two --
copying the parent's region and calendar shape and writing the promotion link both ways. Run
it again on the league it just made and you get a fourth division, and again for a fifth:

```
python tools\deepen.py --root <root> --league 60 --below 81   # your league becomes Ligue 3
python tools\deepen.py --root <root> --league 61 --below 60   # and this one Ligue 4
```

Anything below the third division promotes upwards out of the box but is never relegated
into, until you install `sider/experimental/fl26deep4.lua` -- one verified byte that makes the engine's
second relegation gate accept a third division as well as a second. `deepen.py` says so when
it builds one.

There is a better version of that now, also experimental. The rank a league carries is a
**two-bit** field, so D3, D4 and D5 all store the value 3 and nothing can tell them apart --
which is why the League Info panel shows a fourth division as its own lower league.
`sider/experimental/fl26rank.lua` widens the field to three bits and `fl26deeprank.lua`
replaces the one-byte gate with the real rule (read
[sider/experimental/README.md](../sider/experimental/README.md) for the order; `fl26deep4.lua`
must be off). With `fl26rank.lua` installed, build the chain with `--deep-rank` so each child
gets its parent's rank plus one, and renumber a pyramid you built earlier with:

```
python tools\deepen.py --root <root> --retier 20,18,11        # name the TOP league of each chain
```

Be aware that `deepen.py` is the one tool here that writes into a shipped
competition's own record (the parent's relegation pointer), in your livecpk copy of the
table. Nothing is replaced, but Ligue 2's bottom clubs now have somewhere to fall.

### Crests and kits, if you want them to look like sides

A new club has no crest and no kit of its own: in the game it shows no crest and wears the
engine's plain default kit. Two tools fix that, and neither touches a shipped file: both only write files
for ids no shipped file uses.

```
python tools\mkcrests.py --team-bin <your root>\common\etc\pesdb\Team.bin --flags <your root>
python tools\mkkits.py   --team-bin <your root>\common\etc\pesdb\Team.bin --unipar <UniformParameter.bin> --textures <cpklist.txt> --root <your root> --archive
```

`mkcrests.py` draws a distinct two-tone crest per club and needs `pip install pillow`.
`mkkits.py` lends each club a shipped club's first, second and goalkeeper kit; run it with no
arguments to see where `UniformParameter.bin` and the texture list come from.

The files are named the way the engine looks them up, which is not the team id as it
stands. The engine splits the id: the low bits are the number in the path and bits 14-16 pick
a tag. Ids 65536..81919 get the tag `_ACL_` and lose 65536, so club 72163's first kit is
`uniform/team/6627/6627_ACL_1st_realUni.bin`, the same form the game uses for its own AFC
clubs. A file named `72163_DEF_...` is never asked for, and the club plays in the default kit.
`mkkits.py` handles this for any id (`kit_key()` in the tool); if you write kit files by hand
for a new club, use the same rule.

Then go to the [testing guide](testing-guide.md), or, if you are starting from a clean
install, to the [step-by-step walkthrough](step-by-step.md).
